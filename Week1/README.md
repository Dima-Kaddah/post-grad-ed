2. Algorithms I
3. Developer skills: Code reviews
4. Technical Assignment I
5. Questionnaire I

### 1. JavaScript Cardio I

In order to become good at using a programming language, it's important to know the syntax. The various versions. And the different ways these can be used to write useful programs.

In this section you'll get several exercises you can do to train your ability to use the language of JavaScript:

- [.some(), .every(), .find() and [...SPREADS] â€” Array Cardio Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmRfyNg1lw)

### 2. Algorithms I

Thinking algorithmically is an essential part of a developer's mental toolkit. But what is an algorithm?

> An algorithm is a specific set of steps that can be used to solve a (coding) problem.

From this we can infer that `thinking algorithmically` refers to **the ability of thinking in steps**. Applied to programming, it means:

- Splitting a problem up into smaller problems to solve easily.
- Translating the steps into code

You might think, "easier said than done!", and you are right. That's why we practice.

In the following links you'll find several exercises to practice your algorithmic thinking skills! Do at least 5 of them.

### 3. Developer skills: Planning your project

Before starting any project, the first step is to **make a plan**. Doing this for a web application takes a specific process. Learn more about that here:

- [Technical Assignment Tips for HackYourFuture Graduates](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips) (IMPORTANT!)
- [Starting A Serious Web Development Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGGPTskb7c8)
- [The Creation of a Web Application](https://selftaughtcoders.com/creation-of-a-web-application/)

### 4. Technical Assignment I

When applying for jobs a company most likely will give you a technical assignment to do. Why? They want to test your skills.

In this bi-weekly assignment, you're asked to pick a technical assignment from [this list](./../technical-assignments/w1-w2) and work on it for two weeks. Be sure you and your team member agree on the same one.

The first week will be dedicated to finishing the complete assignment. The second will be used to add at least 3 features on top of the application you've built.

Doing this will help you become familiar with the process and give you a sense of what companies are expecting you to be able to do.

Follow the instructions:

- Pick a technical assignment from the first [folder](./../technical-assignments/w1-w2). Take one that's challenging enough for you to spend 2 weeks on (ask your mentor for help if needed)
- Make a plan of action of how you're going to approach this assignment (use the aforementioned resources and do your own research) - Share this plan on the PGP general channel. Include in the planning which additional features you will develop on the second week.
- Complete the assignment before **this FRIDAY 23.59 CET**. 

One tip before you start: imagine doing this for a real company. Because that's the only way you'll train yourself to take it seriously. (And maybe it will even lead to opportunities...). We strongly advice you to check the 'Technical Assignment Tips' document created by one of the PGP mentors: (https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips#technical-assignment-tips). 

### 5. Questionnaire I

Every week you'll be doing a questionnaire. These contain questions that are meant to challenge you and help make explicit what you want out of your career.

The more you think about this and become aware of what you want, the better you'll do in an interview!

The key is to be as honest and elaborate as possible. This means: take all the time you need to answer the questions.

The theme of this week is: "Why do I want to be a software developer"?

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following in the Slack channel [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7):

1. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week

   > Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".

2. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project, find instructions [here](./../how-to-record-concept.md)

3. Already make a pull request including the current state of your technical assigment code and share the full planning in the group.

4. Ask your mentor to review your code and to give you feedback on your video! Remember that when you are working on a company YOU are responsible for your performance. Having said that, be on top of your planning and take an active role in asking for mentoring so you end up with a better project and increase your learnings. Remember that your mentor volunteers to do this because he/she wants to do so, so DON'T BE SHY!
