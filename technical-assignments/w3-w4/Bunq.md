# Bunq Software Developer Assignment

So here you are, our Software Developer assignment! This assignment will be reviewed by one of our own developers, we set the bar high ;-). Just a working code is not enough, we highly value good and clean code. Your code should be secure and well structured (it should be easy to understand and scaled to hundred of endpoints). 

## Assignment
Write a very simple 'chat' application backend. A user should be able to send a simple text message to another user and a user should be able to get the messages sent to him and the author users of those messages. The users and messages should be stored in a simple SQLite database. All communication between the client and server should happen over a simple JSON based protocol over HTTP (which may be periodically refreshed to poll for new messages). A GUI, user registration and user login are not needed but the users should be identified by some token or ID in the HTTP messages and the database. You have the freedom to use any framework and libraries; keep in mind though that we love custom-build. We don't doubt your ability to implement something like this, but itâ€™s the way you do it that interests us. This is your chance to show us your skills, nail it!

Good luck and may the Source be with you!
