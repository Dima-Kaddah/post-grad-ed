# AKQA technical assignment

This exercise is divided in 2 exercises. The first is broken down into 2 parts.

Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/competent-fire-deb09 and fork the project. (Top right corner, press on Fork).

### Exercise 1: Working with React

Part 1 - Analysis
We would like you to check the code in this project and explain exactly what's happening. Some examples would be to explain what every function is doing, how it's accomplishing its goal, how they are bing called etc. However, please explain anything you think is relevant regarding the project.
We would also like to know your thoughts about the code. What's done well? What's done wrong? What could be done better?  There is no right or wrong answer, but it's important for us to see your approach at analysing code.

Please include your answers on the notes.md file in the project.

Part 2 - Code updates & styling
We would like you to add styles to the project. Make any changes that you think necessary. Your changes may help you improve the user experience, apply proper styles or even make it perform better. Please add noted on notes.md describing your changes and the reasoning behind them.
Keep in mind you're not restricted to only use what's provided. Feel free to add any extra libraries you find useful. Please explain which libraries you added and the reason you picked them on notes.md. Feel free to leverage any of the tools listed below if you find them useful (some may be, some may not be useful for this exercise, however, they are all tools we use at AKQA)
