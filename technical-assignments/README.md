# Technical Assignments (TA)

Technical assignments are an essential part of the job application process. At first it might seem like a daunting challenge, but understanding the mechanics and learning the right approach will help you feel more relaxed about it. This in turn will help you increase your chance of getting the job!

**Important!** If you receive a technical assignment for a real job opportunity, please be sure to contact your mentor or Education Director. While they cannot do any of the code for you, they will help you make a plan, discuss the requirements and ensure that you do as well as possible on the assignment. 

## The why of TAs

Technical assignments aren't made to torture you (even though it might feel that way). Instead, they are made for 2 main reasons:

- It's a simulation of the work you'll be doing for the company
- It gives the company an understanding of your skill set

All a company wants is to **find the right people, for the right job**. As a software developer they'd like you to write good software. Of course, you don't have to write a complete application to show them what you can do. They neither have the time nor the money to go through it.

Instead, they want to quickly see if you possess the skills needed to do the job. This is why the technical assignment exists.

## The what of TAs

Technical assignments can be looked at from 3 perspectives:

1. Technology stack

The technology required to use in the assignment is always related to what the company itself uses. If they work with React, they'll ask you to build React components. If it's PHP, the same thing applies.

2. Topic

The actual topic of the assignment can vary, but it will generally deal with (a part of) the product/service they offer. Here's a common example:

- [DatHuis](https://github.com/robvk/dh-frontend-assignment)

If you look at the assignment, and then at their [website](https://www.dathuis.nl), you can notice the similarities.

3. Time

Some companies will give you all the time you need to finish it. You have to come up with a deadline, and then stick to it. Other companies give you deadline themselves, and expect you to deliver on time.

This timeliness is important, because it shows several things: are you able to deliver on what you say, within a given time? Are you able to ask for help, before it's too late?

## Mindset

You're probably reading this and thinking: "how the hell am I going to do this? I have no idea of what to expect!"

First, take a breath. You **always** function better when you're calm. After having calmed down, you should think the following: I will do the best I can at this stage of my ability.

If you do fail, that's ok. You are here to learn and these assignments just serve to show you what your current skill level is. Take the lesson and try again!

Also, if you receive a technical assignment for a job application, **always ask for help!** We have experienced that many students feel they have to do the technical assignment all by themselves and are afraid to ask for help. Do ask for our support - the HYF community is also available to help you during your job, so not much difference there :) Needless to say, we will never code the application for you, but discuss the requirements instead to be sure you are approaching it the right way. If you get stuck during the assignment you might miss out on a job!
