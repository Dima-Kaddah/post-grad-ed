# Mentoring PostGrad Students

The purpose of the module is to prepare students for a job interview both in terms of soft and technical skills. They will repeat the fundamentals learned on our course (web application development, algorithmic thinking and technical communication) by doing different coding challenges and by working on real technical assignments received from companies.

## Your role
As a mentor you will work closely with your two students. Some of the activities of a PGP mentor are:

- Review student's explanations of technical concepts done through videos - 1 per week. 
- Help students understand how to approach technical assignments. Check [this document](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips) with tips and tricks we think are important.
- Review the code they write. This can be done through a call with your 2 mentees at a time to save time, do it directly on the code, or however you think is best. The important thing here is that the student can improve the quality of their code and learn from their mistakes.
- Have weekly calls with them to discuss the TAs and technical videos and motivate the student to take the TA to the next level - Depending on the quality of the project, students can add it to their CV as a personal project.
- Act as a real employer/interviewer every time they submit their Technical Assignments giving feedback and interviewing the student.
- Assess whether their mindset and attitude is improving throughout the 4 weeks
- Complete a [Performance review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X69WKezQn7X3TYW14RoV6RDiJM-G0HEhX7jT5ddDVo/copy) for each of your mentees.

## Each week, students have to deliver:

- A 5 minute long video in which they explain 1 web development concept, including self-written code examples.
- A technical assignment planning including what to do, and the new features to be added (weeks 2 and 4).
- The technical assignment: Week 1 (and 3) they will deliver a Technical assignment with all its functionality and requirements, and week 2 (and 4) they will add at least 3 new features.

Students should post the links to these in the #postgraduation channel so other students can also see and comment on the work.

## Topics suggestions to be covered in your meetings with the students
	
### GENERAL
What have you learned this week?
What did you find difficult?
How many hours have you coded this week?

### VIDEO
How was the video making process this week?
Can you re-explain the concept to me?

### TECHNICAL ASSIGNMENT
Do you know how to approach this assignment? Please explain me
How’s the progress going?
Are you experiencing any obstacles?
How can you improve this assignment to impress the employer?

## GIVING FEEDBACK
As there are different types of assignments, each deserves a slightly different type of feedback:

### The video can be given feedback through direct message on Slack. Here are the criteria it must fulfill:
- Are they explaining the concept correctly?
- Are they using a self-written code example?
- Could they use better language to describe things? If so, what would you change?

### The technical assignment can be given feedback to, through reviewing a pull request on GitHub (in the 2nd and 4th week). Here are the criteria it must fulfill:
- Are the requirements of the assignment fulfilled?
- Is the code clean?
- Was the student able to finish it in time?
- If the quality was not good, did the student ask for any help/clarification?

## Other notes:
- At the end of the 4-week practice, you can send your mentee a sort of performance review to share with him/her what’s going well and what could use improvement. Please share this also with the HYF team so we know how things are going with the student and if he/she is ready to be introduced to companies! You can find a template for that [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X69WKezQn7X3TYW14RoV6RDiJM-G0HEhX7jT5ddDVo/copy). If you feel the student is not performing well, please communicate with the HYF team.
- Students are expected to spend between 20-40 hours in this practice to really make progress in the 4 weeks. If you don’t see this happening, please address it.
- Weekly deadlines should be always respected. Besides teaching students how to code and do technical assignments, we want to also teach them good communication and planning skills.
- After 4 versions of the Postgraduation package, we noticed that some students need more support than what they like to admit. For that reason, we suggest you take this as an active mentorship, in which you pre-plan a +/- 10 min kick of the week (where students share with you what they will be working on) and a  +/- 10 min end of week meeting to present progress. Additionally you can plan a longer session for live code, codereview, etc and you can of course also create a separate slack group for your mentees to ask you specific questions.
- Try to motivate the student not to only comply with the minimum requirements of the assignment but to do their upmost best. If the TAs look and work good, they can be part of their CVs which is crucial at this point, given that they do not have many projects to show their skills yet.
- This module can still use quite some improvement. Please do share your thoughts and ideas with the HYF team so we can make it better! Thanks for your help!
