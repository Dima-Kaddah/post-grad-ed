### 2. Algorithms II

Let's continue with more algorithm challenges. Like last week, try to solve at least 5 of them.

Do research, try to think step-by-step. And always remember that **there are multiple solutions to the same problem**.

### 3. Developer skills: Code reviews

An absolute essential skill of a great developer is the ability to do code reviews. This will not only make you a better developer, but also a great colleague! Review the documentation below and review your own code! What can you do better?

### 4. Technical Assignment I

Continue with the technical assignment. This week you will have to add the 3 features that are not part of the original requirements but that you added on your planning on week 1. 

For the last part of the TA you will have to test it, deploy it and follow all recommendations included [here](https://github.com/riccardobevilacqua/technical-assignment-tips#technical-assignment-tips). Once all is working and before the deadline, share your code page and deployed app on the PGP channel.

And like previous weeks, make a video explaining one concept you've learned most about during the development of this project and post the video in the Slack channel!

### 5. Questionnaire II

This week we'll continue with another set of questions. This week is more about you as a professional. Have you ever thought about what your interpersonal skills in a professional context? What value could you add to a team, business or enterprise?

The theme of this week is: "How are my interpersonal skills?"

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following in the Slack channel [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7):

1. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week

   > Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".

2. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project, find instructions [here](./../how-to-record-concept.md)

3. A link to your GitHub repo for the technical assignment and a link with the deployed TA so we can all test and use it.
