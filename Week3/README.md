# Postgrad Practice Week 3

## Agenda

1. JavaScript Cardio III
2. Algorithms III
3. Developer skills: Writing documentation
4. Technical Assignment II
5. Questionnaire III

### 1. JavaScript Cardio

It's time for some more Cardio! Follow the instructor and code along. A useful tip while learning is this: don't just brainlessly follow along. Instead, question what he's doing: why this way and not that way?

### 2. Algorithms III

It's time for some more advanced algorithm challenges. These build on your skills gained from the previous week.

If it seems daunting, don't worry! You don't need to be a genius to solve them.

Here's the secret behind algorithm challenges: **they're actually solutions to common programming problems**. If you can learn, memorize and understand them, you'll become a great developer in no time!

Do at least 5 of the following challenges:

### 3. Developer skills: Writing documentation

Another important developer skill is to ability to **write** documentation. In practice you would usually only **use** documentation, but

- [How To Use Developer Documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PLS3SQHQ0)

Practice this new skill on your new TA and add it to the apps GitHub Repo!

### 4. Technical Assignment II

It's time for another technical assignment! 

Go to the second [list](./../technical-assignments/w3-w4) and choose a new technical assignment. Be sure you and your team member agree on the same one.

You're now 50% in! You're doing great! Let's continue this week with the third part of the course.

Follow the instructions:

- Pick a technical assignment that's challenging enough for you to spend 2 weeks on (ask your mentor for help if needed)
- Make a plan of action of how you're goign to approach this assignment (use the aforementioned resources and share your final planning including the new features you will add to the app in the PGP channel)
- Work on this assignment for one week **Deadline is next week FRIDAY 23.59 CET.** and in the final week add the new features and deploy it.

While you're doing it, I'd like you to reflect on the list of concepts shared with you at the beginning of the week:

```md
- JavaScript fundamentals (basic syntax, event loop, OOP)
- Form validation
- HTTP
- Synchronous versus asynchronous
- Authentication & authorization
- Client-server model
- The role of JSON (parse, stringify)
- API routing/client-side routing
- Database modeling
- Frontend state management
- Code modularization
- Working with external services/APIs
```

Are you able to understand them better now? If asked, would you be able to explain each concept and also how it applies to your project?

Keep committing your work to your remote repository. Practice makes perfect.

### 5. Questionnaire III

This week you'll be challenged to think about your aspiration as a developer. What type of developer would you like to be, and where do you see yourself working?

The theme of this week is: "What type of developer do I want to be?"

- [Week 3 Questionnaire](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/h3rsXpWq)

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following in the PGP Slack channel:

1. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week

   > Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".

2. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project, find instructions [here](./../how-to-record-concept.md)

3. Already make a pull request with including the current state of your technical assigment code and share your 2 TA planning including the new features you will code next week.

4. Perform a code review on your pull request. For instructions on how to do this, look [here](./../how-to-code-review.md). What can you do better? Also connect with your mentor to get their feedback!
